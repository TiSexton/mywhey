			<h1>Where do I Buy Whey Protein?</h1>
			
				<p>Whey Protein is sold everywhere: online, health food stores, grocery stores and even drugstores. But, I prefer buying online because you can usually find better deals. But sometimes I'll just go to Vitamin Shoppe, GNC or WholeFoods.

The best deals are online. You can also get it at GNC or Vitamin Shoppe.

			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding:0"><h4>2. <a href="http://www.theisopurecompany.com/products/powders.html" target="_blank">IsoPure Zero Carb</a></h4>I just started drinking these in June. They're cool, refreshing and portable. There are a lot of flavors and taste great ice cold. These will be my go-to drink this summer and probably every summer. I normally go to a GNC or Vitamin Shoppe store to buy these.

			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding:0"><h4>3. <a href="https://www.infitnitude.com/" target="_blank">InFitnitude French Toast</a></h4>This one is special. I reserve it for protein pancakes. But if you don't have the time to make pancakes, it's also good for drinks and smoothies. You can only get it online from their website. If you decide to try this one, put in code Karla25 for a 25% off discount.

			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding:0"><h4>4. <a href="http://www.gnc.com/home/index.jsp" target="_blank">GNC Lean Shake</a></h4>Quick Tip: Leave these in your fridge and grab one when you walk out the door. They're good as is or, if you have a spare minute, mix it with whatever fruit or vegetable you like. FYI - they offer Pumpkin Spice in the Fall.
